# ISES_ISEE_Workshop
Introduction to Double Robust Estimation for Causal Inference

Workshop Goals: 
(a.) Introduce the Roadmap for causal inference with an applied example.
(b.) In R, implement the simple substitution estimator (a.k.a. parametric G-computation) and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with the ensemble algorithm Super Learner for estimation of the eect of a binary exposure. 
(c.) Show the ltmle and drtmle packages in R. 
(d.) Time-permitting: Explore the performance of the estimators with simulations.
